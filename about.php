                                <p>The Idea of establishing an entrepreneurship Cell inside KIIT University came into existence in the year 2012 after a few revolting students from different streams of engineering participated in one of the highly acknowledged events in the Startup world, The Entrepreneurship Summit, IIT Kharagpur. The visit initially meant only for learning purposes turned out to be a landmark event in establishing an Entrepreneurial Ecosystem inside the KIIT University. What initially was just a day dream became reality on 5 April 2013 when KIIT E-Cell organized its first session and opened the gates for the immensely talented students of the University. Since that day the KIIT E-Cell has been providing huge opportunities for the masses. KIIT E-Cell owes it all to those revolutionaries like Tanmay Dayal, Sreejit Bakshi, Mohit Dayal and Pratik Basu.</p>

                                <p>There were four pre-induction sessions starting from 12th july to 9th August. The first one was based on in demand skill of 'Digital Marketing' which is more affordable and quick advertising technique having longer shelf lives and are easier to attach to other campaigns. It gives the brand more time and space to tell its story. The second one being on 'Ideation' that uncovered the implicit knowledge and different perspectives on a situation. In addition to purging your mind , it is a fun way to find solutions and recovering enthusiasm in the team. Followed by a third session where the guests talked about an essential component in any business's success or failure i.e the 'Corporate culture'. It is the belief and behaviour that determine how a company's employees and management interact and handle outside business transactions. Followed by a fourth session by Google Business Group, Bhubaneswar. These were followed by a recruitment procedure for the new batch comprising of group discussion followed by a case study and personal interview in Sept 2014.</p>
